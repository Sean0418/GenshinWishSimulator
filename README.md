# GenshinWishSimulator

This is a personal project. 

The probability of pulls of 5-stars in this simulator is from https://www.hoyolab.com/article/260980. 
I used this formula "factor = 176.10^13*e^(-0.392*pityCounter)" and (factor/1000) is the probability of getting a 5-star on any given pity. 

There is a standard banner and event banner option. 
User inputs the amount of primogems, intertwined fates, and acqaint fates that have at the beginning. 
User can choose to convert primogems to the desired fates. 

The program simulates the probability of obtaining certain items or characters in this game called "Genshin Impact."

Intructions
1. Download the files in "bin" into the same folder. (file names: App.class, Account.class)
2. Open up command prompt, and navigate to the folder you just created. 
  ***To navigate to the folder, if you downloaded it onto your C drive (default drive), you can type "cd [path to folder where the 2 files are at]" to get there. 
  ***If you downloaded onto your hard drive, for example, E drive, you can type "E:" (general form: "[Drive-Name]:) to go to E drive, then type type "cd [path to folder where the 2 files are at]" to get to the folder.  
3. In the command promt after you have navigated to the folder where the 2 files are present, type "java App" and press enter.
4. The program should be loaded. Happy wishing!
