# GenshinWishSimulator

This is a personal project. 

The probability of pulls of 5-stars in this simulator is from https://www.hoyolab.com/article/260980. 
I used this formula "factor = 176.10^13*e^(-0.392*pityCounter)" and (factor/1000) is the probability of getting a 5-star on any given pity. 

There is a standard banner and event banner option. 
User inputs the amount of primogems, intertwined fates, and acqaint fates that have at the beginning. 
User can choose to convert primogems to the desired fates. 

The program simulates the probability of obtaining certain items or characters in this game called "Genshin Impact."
